# FixAfricaLog
A fun and rewarding way to fix Africa's problem with Bitcoin

# Project Overview:
FixAfricaLog is an Angular-based web wallet application with integrated blogging features. It leverages the tbDEX protocol for secure transactions, connects to liquidity providers (PFIs), and allows users to tip blog authors. The application will also manage customers' decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).

# Key Features and Objectives:
1. Integration with tbDEX Protocol:
   - The app will connect to the following liquidity providers (PFIs) in the tbDEX sandbox:
     - AquaFinance Capital
     - Flowback Financial
   
2. Verifiable Credentials:
   - Customers need to present a Verifiable Credential from Ultimate Identity to interact with PFIs.

3. Profitability:
   - The app aims to generate revenue through premium features and possibly transaction fees.

4. Optionality:
   - The app will offer users choices between different PFIs and manage those connections effectively.

5. Customer Management:
   - Manage customer DIDs and Verifiable Credentials efficiently, including obtaining credentials from trusted issuers.

6. Customer Satisfaction:
   - Track customer satisfaction with PFIs through a feedback mechanism.
